## About Squads

Squads is an enterprise platform that enables businesses to run their operations onchain. With Squads, businesses can deploy a smart account, configure it to satisfy their security and organizational requirements, and then use it to manage a wide range of onchain assets such as:

- Treasury;
- Program upgrade authorities;
- Admin keys;
- Tokens;
- and Validators.

The process of developing a protocol or product in crypto has many unique aspects and challenges that do not exist in a traditional web2 environment. Unique challenges require unique solutions. With Squads, our goal is to bring a traditional SaaS-like product experience to onchain asset management in a way that feels familiar and intuitive to both traditional and crypto-native businesses.

Squads achieves this by solving three core problems when it comes to managing onchain assets:

- **User experience** - We have transformed a lot of the experiences that previously required developers to interact with the CLI into well-designed user flows all contained within an intuitive interface.

- **Security** - Squads is built on top of Squads Protocol, Solana's smart account standard that enables ownership of these assets with multi-signature logic, allowing teams to manage various on-chain assets together in an intuitive, secure and decentralized way.

- **Transparency** - We enhance transparency for teams by giving main stakeholders increased visibility and the ability to approve critical actions for project development. This is achieved by requiring multisig approvals for managing assets, making relevant data accessible and human-readable.

We provide teams with greater transparency, allowing for the main stakeholders to have more visibility and a way to approve actions critical for the development of their project by requiring multisig approvals for the management of assets, parsing a lot of the relevant data in our interface and making it human readable.

## Squads Protocol

Squads Protocol is a collection of programs (smart contracts) that enables developers to use smart account technology to build novel asset management and self-custody solutions. Since its launch in 2021, Squads Protocol has become Solana's smart account standard - securing $10+ billion in value for leading teams, applications, and institutions.

Squads, built on Squads Protocol, is an onchain workflow solution that offers teams the security and programmability of smart accounts in a seamless and intuitive interface.
